inkscape-centerline-trace
=========================

Inkscape extension written with python-Pillow. 
It uses 'autotrace -centerline' and an optimal threshold to vectorize a pixel image.
See centerline-tracing.svg for an illustration of the idea.


Unfinished command line tool. 
Works great with testdata, to be integrated into inkscape.
